    "\n",
    "> Use of a high-level computer language for mathematical and scientific  experimentation, simulation, and calculation. Programming of mathematics using available functions and routines and also writing short programs for symbolic and numerical computations, visualization, graphical output, and data management.  The purpose of the course is to become competent with a high-level mathematics language and to practice programming in such a language. The emphasis is on hands-on coding for experimentation in a variety of mathematical and physical contexts, rather than the theory behind it. \n",

    "## Main ways in which scientists and mathematicians use computers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "Data is generated all the time when experiments or simulations are carried out. Confronting both with each other or with models involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* move, store, archive data\n",
    "* analyse data \n",
    "* model data\n",
    "* statistics (see below)\n",
    "* visualise data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "If we understand the physics then the real world should resemble the correct (need to talk about that more ...) solution of the appropriate laws of nature, such as the **Conservation Laws**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* energy\n",
    "* momentum\n",
    "* mass\n",
    "* charge\n",
    "\n",
    "Then solve the relevant fundamental laws of physics. Real-world problems have some challenges though:\n",
    "\n",
    "* multi-physics: include simultaneously different physics components, such as conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy as well as the Maxwell equations for a magneto-hydrodynamics problem\n",
    "* multi-scale: processes on vastly different temporal and spatial scales are simultaneously important and interacting\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical simulations combine the above challenges in ways impossible with purely analytical approaches. The simulations of high quality are numerical experiments that reveal the complex and non-linear behaviour of the appropriate combination of physics laws. This approach provides scientific insight in wasy that complement traditional theory and physical experimental.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** models and simulations are different things!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Solve mathematical problems numerically. Examples include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* integrating a function or differential equation\n",
    "* finding the root of an equation\n",
    "* solving a linear algebra problem with many variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Although many would associate _data_ with statistics, I would put it here. Applying a statistical analysis requires lots of methods and techniques of numerical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symbolic computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the availability of powerful simulation codes and libraries to rapidly deploy proven methods in numerical analysis we need to be able to work with complicated mathematics in an analytical fashion. The laws of physics come in the language of mathematics, and we need to _speak_ that language to understand physics and to write down new physics insights. Symbolic computing is a powerful way to support that. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Utilities\n",
    "There are numerous tasks that we have to be familiar with that are common to more than one of the above roles, or that make our live simply easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. reading and writing data (IO) \n",
    "2. visualizing, plotting data\n",
    "3. programming\n",
    "3. (distributed) version control\n",
    "4. documentation and sharing software\n",
    "5. networking & storage\n",
    "6. using libraries (e.g. for numerical analysis!)\n",
    "8. parallel/threaded computing\n",
    "9. debugging techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__In this course it is the goal that you obtain an introduction to all of the above by looking at specific physics examples.__"

    "### Your laptop\n",
    "You are expected to have some kind of laptop. The kind does not matter. Your laptop must be able to connect to the wireless network on campus. You are also expected that your battery lasts for one hour. You should be able to bring that laptop to class and to the tutorials. \n",

We want to have all the same system so that we are not bogged down too much by technical problems. We are going to create a virtual machine for that purpose. There are many virtualization technologies out there. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) is a freely available tool that works very well. A virtualization software provides a virtual computer into which we can install a variety of different operating systems, such as various flavours of Linux. Linux is a unix-like operating system (OS) and serves well as a teaching platform. All the tools that we will need are available as open source or feely downloadable. At the end of this class your personal version of the **physma** virtual machine will be useful tool that allows you to perform many tasks during your further undergraduate education, and beyond!\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributed version control system\n",
    "In this class we will share lecture notes, assignments, problem sets, exams etc. in the same way software development teams would. In any such team it would be important not only to share pieces of code and other information but to attrubute it and to document when and where work has been added and changes have been made. In this way the team can review changes to a previous version, find bugs and easily use previous versions. Another advantage is that everybody can make changes to their own copy and later merge the changes back to a common code base. We will adopt the _distributed version control system_ [git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) and we will use the git server platform [GitHub](https://github.com).\n",

    "### Chat room\n",
    "In a software team exchange of information and technical skills is a continuous requirement. Email is a one-to-one communication which does not work well when questions and answers are likely of more general interest, and if more than one person in the group could provide an answer. Instead a chat room serves the purpose better. In this class you would try hard to _not_ email the TA or instructor but instead ask and get answers in a chat room. The TA will monitor the chat room. We will use the public XMPP based jabber peer-to-peer network.\n",
