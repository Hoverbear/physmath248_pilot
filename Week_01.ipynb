    "\n",
    "This is a pilot course for an upcoming new 2$^\\mathrm{nd}$ year course _\n",
    "Computer Assisted Mathematics/Physics_. This course is offered jointly \n",
    "by the Mathematics and Physics & Astronomy Departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Math 248 Units: 1.5.  Hours: 2-1-0. \n",
    "Also: PHYS 248\n",
    "\n",
    "The calendar entry summarizes the goal of this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Use of a high-level computer language for mathematical and scientific  experimentation, simulation, and calculation. Programming of mathematics using available functions and routines and also writing short programs for symbolic and numerical computations, visualization, graphical output, and data management.  The purpose of the course is to become competent with a high-level mathematics language and to practice programming in such a language. The emphasis is on hands-on coding for experimentation in a variety of mathematical and physical contexts, rather than the theory behind it. \n",

    "* freely available\n",
    "* very mature\n",
    "* used by scientist in their day-to-day operation, and by many others (including, apparently, Youtube and Dropbox)\n",
