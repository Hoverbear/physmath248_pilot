    "# Git essentials\n",
    "This short guide provides an introdocution to git and coveres briefly the most important features. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics and resources\n",
    "\n",
    " _git_ as a distributed version control system (DVCS). A good introduction and reference is [Pro Git book](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2).\n",
    "\n",
    "* why using a DCVS systemt\n",
    "* fundamental concepts\n",
    "* how are we going to use git \n",
    "    - there is one public course repository\n",
    "    - each of you will have your own private repository that you share with both instructors and the tutor\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "* get account on github\n",
    "* create new repo on github page with name `248_w16_lastname`\n",
    "* in your **CompVM** open a terminal window and clone the new repo: `git clone https://github.com/your_user_name/248_w16_lastname_firstname`\n",
    "* add some content\n",
    "    - edit, stage, commit\n",
    "    - working with remotes: push and pull\n",
    "\n",
    "**Homework:**\n",
    "* study chapter 1 and 2 in the _Pro Git book_. You may also follow the short interactive tutorial at <https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple tasks\n",
    "Use the git repository to store and version control data in your own repos, and to get things from the course repo:\n",
    "\n",
    "* clone the course repo\n",
    "* `git pull` to update your repo; `git pull` is doing two things in sequence that at some point you may decide to do separately\n",
    "    - first it does `git fetch` which updates your local repo with all information from the remote,but it does not change any file on your active branch\n",
    "    - second it performs a `git merge` which does update files in your current branch\n",
    "    - for the course repo using `git pull` is entirely appropriate because you would not add anything yourself, and `merge` really means _just add the new things_\n",
    "\n",
    "For your own repo occasionally you do\n",
    "\n",
    "* `git add` to stage files you have newly created or modified for the next `commit` to the index\n",
    "* `git commit` creates a snapshot of the repo as it is staged in the index\n",
    "* `git push` will move the snapshot and the repo info to the remote repo on bitbucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git status` shows the status of your repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branching & merging\n",
    "\n",
    "While your assignments are reviewed and checked you have continued to create snapshots in your repo. The instructor will have `pull`ed your repo at the due date of the assignment. The instructor will then create a branch and move _HEAD_ to the new branch:\n",
    " \n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git branch check1\n",
    "$ git checkout check1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All changes the instructor now makes to your repo will be done on a branch created at the time when the assignment was due. After changes and comments have been made to that _check_ branch the instructor will push that branch back to your repo. **In order for that to work your instructor needs write access to your repo.** The instructor will use \n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git push --set-upstream origin check1\n",
    "```\n",
    "to create the new branch at the remote (_origin_). You will now get an email alerting you to the new branch in your repo. When you now look at the _commit_ view on bitbucket and select _All branches_ or _Show all_ you will see the new _check_ branch has appeared. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are now at least two things you can do. \n",
    "\n",
    "* First you can look at the changes introduced in the check branch online on the bitbucket web page. Go to _branches_ where it should show your master as the main branch. Select the _check_ branch and then the _Diff_ tab to get an overview of the changes.\n",
    "* But you probably want to get the check branch on your local repo. Instead of doing `git pull` it is recommend to do `git fetch` and then `git merge` as desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "`git fetch` will leave the `HEAD` on the `master` but you can switch to the `check` branch with `$ git checkout check1`. Now you can look at the changes and comments your instructor left in your `check` branch. If you switch the `HEAD` back to `master` (`git checkout master`) you may use `git merge` to merge the `check` branch with your main branch:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git merge check1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitbucket provides a visual representation of the repo tree with the various branches. On the command line the equivalent information can be obtained with\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git log --all --oneline --decorate --graph\n",
    "```\n"
